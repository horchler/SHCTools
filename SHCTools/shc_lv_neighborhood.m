function delta=shc_lv_neighborhood(bet,kappa)
%SHC_LV NEIGHBORHOOD  Scaled neighborhood-size for Lotka-Volterra SHC network.
%   DELTA = SHC_LV_NEIGHBORHOOD(BETA) returns the scaled neighborhood size(s)
%   DELTA for the specified state magnitude(s) BETA. BETA is a finite real
%   floating-point vector. DELTA = KAPPA*BETA, where the default value of the
%   neighborhood size scaling factor KAPPA is 0.1.
%   
%   DELTA = SHC_LV_NEIGHBORHOOD(BETA,KAPPA) is the same as above except the
%   neighborhood size scaling factor is set to the input KAPPA using a
%   persistent variable. Subsequent calls to SHC_LV_NEIGHBORHOOD(BETA) will use
%   this value until it is changed, the function is cleared, or Matlab is
%   relaunched. KAPPA should be a finite real floating-point scalar greter than
%   zero and less than 0.5.
