function a0=shc_lv_ic(dt,rho,alpha,epsilon)
%SHC_LV_IC  Find initial condition on Lotka-Volterra SHC manifold.
%   A0 = SHC_LV_IC(DT,RHO,ALPHA,EPSILON) returns an initial condition A0 on the
%   manifold of the Lotka-Volterra SHC defined by the N-dimensional connection
%   matrix RHO, growth rates ALPHA, and noise magnitude EPSILON. ALPHA must be a
%   finite real floating-point scalar or length N vector. EPSILON must be a
%   finite real floating-point scalar. DT is a positive floating-point scalar
%   specifying the integration step size.
%
%   The initial condition found will lie along the incomming edge of the
%   neighborhood of the first node, i.e., A0(1) = BETA(1)-DELTA(1), where BETA
%   is the vector of state magnitudes and DELTA is the value returned by
%   SHC_LV_NEIGHBORHOOD.
