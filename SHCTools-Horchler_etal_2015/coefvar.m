function y=coefvar(x,flag,dim)
%COEFVAR  Coefficient of variation for data samples.
%   Y = COEFVAR(X) returns the coefficient of variation of the values in the
%   vector X. The coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the
%   standard deviation to the mean. If X is a matrix, Y is a row vector
%   containing the coefficient of variation of each column of X. For N-D arrays,
%   COEFVAR operates along the first non-singleton dimension of X.
%
%   COEFVAR normalizes Y by N-1 if N > 1, where N is the sample size. This is an
%   unbiased estimator of the variance of the population from which X is drawn,
%   as long as X consists of independent, identically distributed samples. For
%   N = 1, Y is normalized by N.
%
%   COEFVAR(X,1) normalizes by N and produces the second moment of the sample
%   about its mean. COEFVAR(X,0) is the same as COEFVAR(X).
%
%   Y = COEFVAR(X,FLAG,DIM) returns the coefficient of variation along the
%   dimension DIM of X.
